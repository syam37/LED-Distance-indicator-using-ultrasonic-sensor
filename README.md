# LED-Distance-indicator-using-ultrasonic-sensor
The project is designed to develop distance measurement system using ultrasonic waves and interfaced with arduino. We know that human audible range is 20hz to 20khz. The distance of an obstacle from the sensor is measured through ultrasonic sensor. After knowing the speed of sound the distance can be calculated.
